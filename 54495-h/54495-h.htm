<p>Importance of the definite teaching of manners. Children
are close imitators; they will learn some kind of
manners, and one who teaches positively or emphatically
(or contrariwise) may often see a miniature of himself
in his young pupil. With this truth in mind one
can hardly attach too much importance to punctilious
politeness on the teacher’s part in his intercourse with
pupils. But however polite a teacher may be, the informal
or unconscious teaching of manners is not
enough. The school-room does not afford opportunity
to exemplify all the necessary practices in good manners,
and there is no other way but to teach the various
requirements of an accepted code with reference to actual
examples that may present themselves at any time in
life.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that many children have no
opportunity of obtaining a knowledge of good manners,
either by practice or precept, except as it is afforded by
the schools. And as habits formed in childhood are the
most enduring, a lack of early training in good manners
will show itself as long as life lasts. Many other reasons
weigh in favor of the definite teaching of manners, one
of which is, if courtesy is demanded of pupils.</p>

<p>The underlying principles of courtesy should be inculcated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
that children may know it is more than an
empty show.</p>

<p>Children need to learn the definite language <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'courtesy employes'">courtesy
employs</ins>. This to many children is a new language,
and can only be accomplished by definite teaching. Beside,
if manners are considered of sufficient importance
to be counted a regular part of the school, they will
attract much more importance. Accompanying this by
observance on the part of teacher, the pupil acquires a
valuable knowledge.</p>

<p>Good manners ever prove an invaluable aid in doing
away with many of the unpleasantnesses of school-life.
Courtesy of manner under all circumstances means great
self-control, and a lack of self-control in teacher or
pupil is the origin of most misdemeanors in school.
Aside from the benefits to be derived in the school-room,
gentle manners help one on in the world wonderfully.
They are more powerful in many cases than
their other knowledge. “All doors fly open to the one
who possesses them.”</p>

<p>“Manners are the shadows of great virtues.”&mdash;<cite>Whately.</cite>
“High thoughts seated in a heart of courtesy.”&mdash;<cite>Sir
Philip Sidney.</cite> Mr. Calvert says: “A gentleman is
never unduly familiar; takes no liberties; is chary of
questions; is neither artificial nor affected; is as little
obtrusive upon the mind or feelings of others as on their
persons; bears himself tenderly toward the weak and
unprotected; is not arrogant; cannot be supercilious; can
be self-denying without struggle; is not vain of his
advantages; habitually subordinates his lower to his
higher self; is, in his best condition, electric with truth,
buoyant with veracity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><em>In a right conception of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'good breading'">good breeding</ins> the moral
element predominates.</em> With this idea in view, no one
should attempt to instruct in good manners who has
not the ability to instil into the minds of children its
<em>fundamental principles</em>. True courtesy implies strict
honor, self-possession, forbearance, generous and refined
feeling, all culminating in a polished deportment.</p>

<p>When teachers consider manners in this high sense,
and teach them accordingly, they give their pupils that
which will bring them much more happiness in life than
any amount of knowledge teaching without it.</p>


<h3>AIM OF THIS WORK.</h3>

<p>1. To furnish material for lessons in manners suitable
to be taught in the schools, and adapted to different
grades of pupils.</p>

<p>2. To furnish illustrative lessons showing the main
lines of thought to be pursued, the length of the lesson,
and the simplicity of method to be employed.</p>

<p>3. To impress both teachers and pupils with a need
of the knowledge of good manners.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR TEACHING MANNERS.</span></h3>
    </div>

<p><b>1.</b> In teaching manners to young children there is no
better example to be followed than that of a careful
mother, who takes advantage of incidents of every-day
life to impress a truth upon the mind of her child. By
such means the ideal standard is kept in close relation
to the child’s conduct until it is taken up and assimilated
into his nature. For this reason it is better to begin
the definite teaching of manners with reference to the
school, and as far as possible to allow actual occurrences
to suggest or illustrate the point to be considered. The
lesson that will fit the needs of the occasion is the most
effective. Just here it may be remarked that, within
bounds, a teacher is justified in taking advantage of
these opportunities, even if it somewhat disturbs the
formality of a rigid programme of school-work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><b>2.</b> The mother’s method may be followed still farther
in making the definite lesson as informal as possible.
Questions should be asked to awaken thought, and the
lesson should partake more of the nature of a familiar
conversation than of a school exercise. Pupils should
be allowed to tell what they know on certain points, and
new truths should be “developed” as in other subjects.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> The instruction to older pupils may be given in a
similar manner, but less simply; or the item may be read
with or without comment. This lesson serves to instruct
those ignorant of prevailing forms, and to keep the
matter before the minds of others who are better informed.
When pupils are old enough, if not provided
with a text-book on manners, it is well for them to
make a note of the directions given.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> The time given to this subject must be regulated
by the other work in the school. A few minutes daily
will amount to a great deal in the course of years.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> A plan that has been successfully pursued is to allow
ten minutes for the opening exercises of school, and
to make a brief lesson in manners a part of these exercises.
It is not the aim of the author that the illustrative
lessons shall be arbitrarily followed. That would be
to aim at an impossibility. If success is expected, it is
even more necessary in this branch than in others that
the work be stamped with the individuality of the
teacher. There must also be a certain compass of expression
and force and earnestness of manner in giving
these lessons which cannot be imparted to the printed
page.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Brevity is essential, as the effect sought would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
lost if the lesson became tiresome. Moreover, it is not
intended to add to the already overburdened curriculum
of most schools. Teachers should exercise care in selecting
items adapted to the age and capacity of their
pupils. It is needless to add that as far as there is opportunity
teachers should see that precept and practice
go hand-in-hand.</p>


<h3 class="p2 fs90 lsp">SPECIAL DIRECTIONS TO TEACHERS.</h3>

<p><b>1.</b> <b>The manners of pupils are usually similar to those
of the teacher.</b> It is therefore of the utmost importance
that he should himself exemplify true courtesy, because
he will be imitated. His whole bearing and manner in
the presence of pupils should be above criticism. If not
conversant with the details of a code of manners, it is
obligatory upon him to become so, and to conform his
manners to it.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> <b>A high and loud tone of voice</b> should not have
place in a school-room.</p>

<p>There is perhaps no more unrefining influence unconsciously
exerted by a teacher than that of a loud voice.
Emerson says, “Loudness is rude, quietness always genteel,”
and in nothing is the truth more apparent than in
the voice. As children are close imitators, if teachers
speak in a loud and dictatorial manner, so will their
pupils.</p>

<p>A teacher’s voice should be as melodious as nature
permits, and its effect should be heightened by all the
modulations and intonations used in polite conversation.
Suitable language <em>voiced</em> in this manner not only has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
most refining influence on the character and manners of
pupils, but is often the only instrumentality needed in
the formal “government” of the school.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> <b>A teacher should assume no attitude in a school-room
which is not proper for the pupils.</b> Here again the
natural propensity of children to imitate should be remembered.
Teachers have been known to censure
children for carelessness in posture when they themselves
were guilty of the same. There is no instruction
of this kind so impressive as that of example, and if
teachers wish their pupils to be patterns of propriety in
attitude, motions, actions, they themselves must furnish
the model.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> <b>Teachers should not be careless in personal habits.</b>
Besides formal instruction relative to habits of cleanliness
and tidiness, the teacher should show the importance of
these habits by strict adherence to them. Teachers
should dress neatly and in good taste. This does not
necessarily involve expense. There should be no gaudiness
of dress, but due attention should be paid to harmony
of color and suitableness of fabric, and garments
should be made in prevailing styles. Attention to these
details will help to refine the tastes of pupils.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> <b>Teachers should watch their tones and words with
great care.</b> It is not enough that expressions should be
grammatical, but they should be devoid of anything inelegant.
All proprieties of speech should be observed, even
(or especially) with the youngest children. <em>Severe</em> expressions,
arising from lack of self-control on the part of
the teacher, are productive of demoralization in the
school, and have a most unrefining effect on the pupils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Let teachers observe the direction which they give to
their pupils,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Guard well while you are young</p>
<p class="verse">Ear and eye and <em>tongue</em>,&mdash;”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">and it will be much more effectual than the memorizing
of the couplet. A polite request is at any time more
refining and effective than a stern command. Instead
of saying “Do this” or “Do that,” if teachers make a
practice of asking “Will you kindly do this?” or
“Please do that,” they will find their wishes more cheerfully
complied with, and less selfishness displayed in the
requests made by pupils.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> <b>Teachers should not only guard their words, but the
expression of their countenances.</b> The expression should
be pleasant and indicative of kindness and common
sense. A stolid expression or constant smiling are both
exceedingly objectionable in a school-room, as elsewhere.</p>

<p>Children are very susceptible either to smiles or
frowns, and both should be used with discretion.
Approving smiles, like approving words, may be given
as rewards, but a too liberal use detracts from their
value. It may seem to be setting up an ideal standard
to say that when in the school-room an angry or a petulant
look should never come upon a teacher’s face. It
is sometimes necessary to express regret, sorrow, or severity
in this manner, but anger and irritability never,
as that shows lack of self-control; and one of the serious
results of such a lack is impoliteness.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> <b>Teachers should not indulge in modes of discipline
that are unrefining in their tendencies.</b> Happily the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
barbaric modes of punishment are passing away. If
complete abolition of corporal punishment does not seem
feasible, any teacher ought to be possessed of sufficient
delicacy and refinement to avoid making such punishment
public. It should <em>never</em> be inflicted in the presence
of the school.</p>


<h3 class="p2 fs90 lsp">PRACTICAL TRAINING IN MANNERS.</h3>

<p><b>1.</b> Ask the children daily to tell what opportunity
they have improved of being kind and polite.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> The teacher should remark on any improvement
shown by the pupils, and lead pupils to talk of it. It is
well to allow them to talk without restraint so as to obtain
their real opinions. Tact will be needed to ward
off a feeling of self-gratulation or conceit, which may
otherwise be brought out when pupils tell of their own
polite acts.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Impress pupils with the idea that good manners is
one of the subjects pursued in the schools, and that it
will help them in life, and that practice shows progress
in this particular branch.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Without seeming to demand it, teachers should lead
children to offer them any service that is <em>not menial</em>.
Such attentions as disposing of wraps, umbrellas, etc.,
fetching them when needed, picking up things accidentally
dropped, handing crayon, eraser, etc., lifting
or moving things, offering a chair, helping to put things
in their places at the close of school, should be rendered
to teachers by pupils. If, at first, in order to make
children see what offices are proper, the teacher must
ask for them, it should be as one would ask an equal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and not a servant; and any service rendered should be
most politely acknowledged.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> The older children should be made to understand
the propriety of assuming some responsibility over the
younger. This is almost universally practiced in schools
where “busy work” is done, when the older pupils help
to distribute materials for such work, and to assist in
its execution. They should also assist those who need
aid in putting on or taking off wraps, overshoes, etc.
Children should understand that girls need not necessarily
assist girls, and boys boys, but that help should be
offered and accepted, as is convenient.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Children should be encouraged to try to settle disputes
or to quell disorder in any form. This does not
imply a system of monitorship. As young children are
pleased to do these things, it needs tact and watchfulness
on the teacher’s part to keep down an overbearing
or officious spirit. This may be accomplished
by appointing certain pupils for a definite length of
time, and by removing them from “office” when they
exceed their authority. These advisers are not to be
encouraged in tale-bearing. It should be considered
just cause for removal, unless the tale is told in order to
get the teacher’s advice as to the best mode of settling a
difficulty.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> Pupils should be trained to receive and entertain
those who come to visit the schools. They should entertain
as politely in a school-room as in a parlor. When
visitors come, a pupil should answer the bell, politely
invite the company to enter, find them comfortable
seats, take their wraps if they wish to dispose of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and offer any other attention the occasion may seem to
demand. To do this properly at the time implies previous
training&mdash;pupils acting as visitors. In this as in
other things, officiousness on the part of pupils should
be guarded against. Give opportunities to all pupils in
turn to show these attentions.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Whenever it is possible, every direction in manners
should be exemplified in the school-room. When
the school-room does not furnish illustrations, directions
should be made as real as possible to the youngest pupils,
as, for instance, they should actually be shown how
to hold the fork, how to drink from a tumbler, how to
enter a room, etc.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> The polite phrases of society should be used by the
teacher to the pupil, and vice versa.</p>

<p>In the discipline of the school, when children have
had training in good manners, the question “Is this
polite?” will oftentimes prove more effectual than a
severe reprimand. This has been demonstrated by actual
experience, even in schools difficult of control.</p>

<p>Suppose a new little girl should come into our room.
Perhaps she would come from a country far away from

not look like any other little girl in the room. What
do you think these boys and girls would do?</p>

<p>“Look at her.”</p>

<p>One day I looked out on the play-ground, where there
were many children playing and seeming to have the
best kind of a time. On the other side of the ground
was one little girl looking as sad and lonely as you can
think. I was about to go and see if I could cheer her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
up, when another little girl whose name was Jennie,
and who had been playing with all her might, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'happpened to see'">happened
to see</ins> her. She left her place and went to the stranger,
and said in a sweet way, “Wouldn’t you like to come
and play too? Come and take my place.” And away
they went hand-in-hand, looking as happy as two butterflies.</p>

<p>Now, what do you think of Jennie?</p>

<p>“She was good.”</p>

<p>“She was kind.”</p>

<p>“She asked the new girl to go and play.”</p>

<p>Was that all?</p>

<p>“She gave up her place in the game that the little
girl might play.”</p>

<p>Was that very kind?</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss B.”</p>

<p>How did it make the little stranger feel?</p>

<p>“Happy.”</p>

<p>What do you say of such acts?</p>

<p>“They are polite.”</p>

<p>How, then, shall we be polite to others?</p>

politeness can be taught unconsciously to the youngest

the next higher grade of lessons, other principles may
be formally taught, and new terms brought out. In

<p>Suppose a boy seated in the easiest chair in the room,
reading and enjoying himself, should rise on seeing his
mother enter, and offer her the chair. What would you
say of that boy?</p>

<p>“That he was kind.”</p>

<p>Then what kind of a heart would you suppose he had?</p>

<p>“A kind heart.”</p>

<p>And of whom did this kind heart lead him to think?</p>

<p>“Of his mother.”</p>

<p>Do you suppose he disliked to give up the chair?</p>

<p>“I think he did.”</p>

<p>“I think he was glad to give it up.”</p>

<p>How could that be?</p>

<p>“Why, he wanted the chair, but he loved his mother

<p>(Some are in doubt.) Let us see. I do not think a
truly kind heart will allow any one to be rude, but how
is it in this case? It is not thought polite to eat with
the knife. Have you ever known kind people to do it?</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss B.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Miss B.”</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>“From other people.”</p>

<p>How from other people?</p>

<p>“They can watch, and do what they see nice people
do.”</p>

<p>And how do these nice people know?</p>

<p>“Perhaps they have watched some other nice people.”</p>

<p>If one who has used his knife in eating learns better,
what ought he to do?</p>

<p>“To stop using it.”</p>

<p>And if he continues to use it, what will be thought of
him?</p>

<p>“That he is odd or queer.”</p>

<p>Should you like to be thought odd or queer?</p>

<p>“No ma’am.”</p>

<p>Then what must you do?</p>

<p>“We must watch people who know what good manners
are, and try to make our manners like theirs.”</p>

<p>What kind of people are polite?</p>

<p>“The best people.”</p>

<p>If we learn to do as the best people do, how shall we
be considered?</p>

<p>“To be <em>best</em> people.”</p>

good.</p>

<p>A boy once wished to find a place to work. He went

stood no chance at all of getting the work, but much to
his surprise <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'he was empoyled'">he was employed</ins>. He said, “Why, sir, I
did not expect it when so many were ahead of me.”
“Do you wish to know why I hired you?” said the gentleman.
“You came in quietly, you took off your hat,
you <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'gave you chair'">gave your chair</ins> to an old man, you stood patiently
until your turn came, and then you spoke pleasantly and
in a manly tone of voice; in fact, I saw you were a well-bred
boy, and that is the reason I hired you.”</p>

<p>If this boy had been rude, what would have happened?</p>

<p>“He would not have been employed.”</p>

<p>How did the gentleman feel toward him?</p>

<p>“He liked him.”</p>

<p>What was his one reason for liking him? He had never
seen him before.</p>

<p>“His manners were good.”</p>

<p>If your manners are good, how will people feel toward
you?</p>

But there is a boy <em>somewhere</em> who has to be called and
called in the morning, and then he yawns, and takes
another nap, and puts off getting out of bed as long as
he possibly can. He is late at breakfast, late in doing
his morning’s work, and late at school. He goes into his
school-room after the rest are at their work, and disturbs
the teacher and the children, feels very unhappy, and
perhaps gets a mark that he does not like.</p>

<p>There is another boy <em>somewhere</em>, and I guess right
here in this room. <em>He</em> does not wait for his mother to
call him, but when it is time he springs out of bed, and
is ready in time for his breakfast, and gets his work done,
and starts for school with a happy face, and arrives there
in time for a game with his school-mates and a pleasant
word with his teacher before school begins. Which one

<p>One time a little girl whom I knew had a birth-day

faces, and pleasantest smiles. They also had brought
the best of something else. Do you know what?</p>

<p>“Their best manners.”</p>

<p>Yes. These same boys and girls were in my school,
and as I saw how lovely they could be at a party, it made
me wish something. Do you know what?</p>

<p>“That they would be so in school.”</p>

whatever she had to do.</p>

<p>When her mamma would say, “Bessie, it is time to
start for school,” she would answer sweetly, “Yes, mamma,
I shall go in a minute,” but the minutes would fly
and Bessie would not start. Of course she was often
late. What trouble did she cause by her tardiness?</p>

<p>One time I heard a mother say to her two boys, “I
wish you to do some work for me. There are the chickens
to be fed, Henry, and old Doll is waiting for Charles
to give her her morning’s meal.” The boys both heard
distinctly. This is how Henry’s face looked: round as an
apple, eyes bright, a pleasant smile on his lips, and with
an “all right, mother,” he started on a run to the barn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
where the hens were. This is how Charles looked: a
long face, eyes dull and sober, a scowl on his forehead,
as he moped along to feed old Doll, after being repeatedly
told to do so by his mother. Tell me what the
first face meant.</p>

<p>“It meant that Henry was the better boy.”</p>

<p>“It meant that he intended to obey his mother.”</p>

<p>“And to do so right off.”</p>

<p>“And in a pleasant way.”</p>

<p>What did the other face mean?</p>

<p>“It meant that Charles did not like to obey.”</p>

<p>“And he intended to take his own time.”</p>

<p>“And he was cross about it.”</p>

<p>Yes, you would know he was ill-natured by the scowl.</p>

<p>What do you say of Henry’s treatment of his mother?</p>

<p>“It was kind and polite.”</p>

<p>Did any of you ever act like Charles? And here
in school? If you treat me kindly and politely, how
will you show it in one way?</p>

<p class="pfs120"><em>The Lesson.</em></p>

<p>I once knew a little girl whom most everybody praised
for being polite. Whenever she met people away from
home, or whenever there was company at her home, she
was very polite to them. She would ask visitors to take
the easiest chairs, she would bring a hassock for their
feet, she would watch their comfort in every way. She
said “Yes, sir,” and “No, Miss B.,” and “Excuse me,”
and “I beg your pardon,” and all those polite things.
One day when I was the visitor and had been treated
very politely by the little girl, I happened to hear her
mother ask her to raise the shade. A little while before,
she had asked me, in the sweetest manner, if she
should lower this same shade for me; but in answer to
her mother’s request she frowned and did not move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
from her chair. Pretty soon her little brother came to
her to be amused, but she pushed him away and said:
“Go away, Harry, I can’t be bothered with you.”
When her father came in tired at night, and asked her
to get his slippers for him, she did it in a very ungracious
manner.</p>

<p>Those who have something to say of this little girl
may raise hands.</p>

<p>“She was not good to her father and mother.”</p>

<p>“Nor to little Harry.”</p>

<p>“She was polite to company.”</p>

<p>“But not to her own people.”</p>

<p>Why should we be polite to our home friends?</p>

<p>“Because they are kind to us, and love us.”</p>

<p>How should we be polite to them?</p>

<p>“We should look out for their comfort.”</p>

<p>“And always speak politely to them.”</p>

<p>Once there was a little boy who was deformed.</p>

<p>Who will tell me what that means?</p>

<p>“It means that he was a hunch-back.”</p>

<p>“Or that he had a queer foot.”</p>

<p>Yes, this poor boy had not feet like yours, and could
walk very little without crutches. One day he was taking
a walk with his nurse, and was trying to take a few
steps without his crutches. Of course it was very hard
work for him, and he went very slowly. Some boys
were skipping down the hill towards him, and he looked
as if he would give all he had in the world if he could
skip too. But what do you suppose these boys did as
they came near? They stopped still, and stared at the
poor little fellow. It made him feel bad, for his cheeks
grew red and tears filled his eyes as he hobbled away
from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>What would you have done, John, if you had been
one of those boys?</p>

<p>“I would have walked right by without looking.”</p>

<p>“I would have looked at his face, but not at his feet.”</p>

<p>“I would have acted as if he were like other boys.”</p>

<p>Yes, that is the way to do. Think how you would
like to be treated if you were in this boy’s place.</p>

<p>Is it the custom of well-bred people to stare at one on
the street?</p>

<p>“No, Miss B.”</p>

<p>We will try to remember then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Never to stare at people on the street.”</p>

<p>A little girl came to the table very hungry. There
were a good many older people there, and as she had
been taught to wait until the older ones were served, she
sat very still and waited very patiently until every one
else at the table was enjoying a nice dinner. She grew
hungry every minute, and could hardly keep the tears
back, but still did not ask for anything. When it was
found that she had been forgotten, but was so patient
and well-behaved, every one praised her, and you may
be sure she had the best dinner they were able to give
her.</p>

<p>Another little girl came to another table very hungry.
She waited for no one, but immediately began to ask
for this and that, and not in the nicest way, either. She
made herself so disagreeable that every one at the table

<p>Johnnie, like many little boys, was fond of sleeping
in the morning. The bed always seemed the softest and
his dreams the most interesting just as the rising bell
rang. He would wake just enough to think there would
be time enough before breakfast to go to sleep again and
finish out that one dream. But nap followed nap until
the sharp ting-a-ling-ling of the breakfast bell roused
him. Then he would <em>try</em> to dress hurriedly, but every
thing generally went wrong, and he would get out to
breakfast too late for the delicious hot cakes the rest of
the family had enjoyed. How do you think it made him
feel to eat a cold breakfast?</p>

<p>“Cross.”</p>

<p>Tell me what you think of such a boy as Johnnie.</p>

<p>“He was lazy.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t do as his mother wished him to.”</p>

<p>Did he make his mother trouble?</p>

<p>“Yes’m. His breakfast had to be kept for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“It would have been kinder if he had eaten with the
rest.”</p>

<p>Think of Johnnie, and tell me what you mean not to
do any more.</p>

<p>“To be late at the table.”</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>“Because it makes trouble and isn’t kind.”</p>

<p>And if not kind?</p>

<p>“Not polite.”</p>

<p>Does this mean the home-table only?</p>

<p>I once sat down to dine at a table where there were
three children. They seemed to be nearly starved, although
I knew they had eaten a good breakfast. As soon
as they had taken their seats they called out, “I want
some bread,” “Give me some meat,” “Pass that jelly;”
and when they were served they began to eat as if it
were their first meal in a long time. I think some of
you would have been surprised at those children’s manners.
What have you to say about them, Jennie?</p>

<p>“They ought to have kept still until they were
served.”</p>

<p>“They ought to have said, ‘I would like some bread,
if you please.’”</p>

<p>“And ‘Will you please give me some meat?’”</p>

<p>“And? ‘Will you be so kind as to pass the jelly?’”</p>

<p>Yes, that would have been much better. What should
you say when something is passed to you at table, and
you do not wish it?</p>

<p>“Not any, I thank you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for any, thank you.”</p>

<p>If you remember to do these things, what will be said

<p class="pfs120"><em>The Lesson.</em></p>

<p>Some one says “True politeness consists in making
every one happy about you.” It is true that forgetfulness
of self and thoughtfulness of the comfort and happiness
of others makes one’s behavior very acceptable
to others. A kind heart is undoubtedly the foundation
of good manners; but if this be so, there are other qualities
of equal importance that form a superstructure on
which good manners rest. We use the term gentleman
and lady with reference to outward appearance, but they
also imply that a person is honest and true and refined.
Who would think of calling one a gentleman if his word
could not be trusted? Charles I. said to the Commoners,
“You have not only the word of a king but of a gentleman.”
Could a lady be guilty of indelicate language?
Would a real gentleman or lady ridicule the unfortunate?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
True courtesy implies much more than an outside show.
Even what seems a mere form is usually founded in
kindness and common sense. It is necessary that we
become familiar with these forms. We do not like to be
called odd or peculiar. We do not like to be considered
ignorant of what good and wise people have decided
it proper and right to do. We wish rather to copy the
manners of the best people that we may gain their esteem
and be classed with them. If we learn and practise
good manners while we are young, when older we
shall practise them unconsciously, as they will have become
a habit.</p>

<p class="pfs120"><em>The Lesson.</em></p>

<p>Young people sometimes seem to think good manners
are to be put on as fine clothes are, not for every-day
wear, but for company only. Those who put this theory
into practice will find that good manners fit them in
company no better than garments cut for some one else.
If manners really spring from a kind heart, they will be
practised everywhere. Good manners in school continually
practised will soon become a habit. Courteous pupils
rarely need reprimand or reproof. They treat their
teacher as they would a friend, and in this way help
greatly in making the school pleasant and profitable.
Such pupils remember their school-days with pleasure.</p>

or questions to be asked.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>The Lesson.</em></p>

<p>In all well-regulated schools, teachers and school-officers
place much stress upon regularity of attendance;
consequently an avoidable or inexcusable absence shows
disrespect to school authority.</p>

<p>When a pupil enters a school-room late it interrupts
and disturbs all who are present. An avoidable interruption
or disturbance is, of course, impolite. Any disregard
of the rules of school shows a lack of respect for
teachers and school-officers. Lack of respect and true
politeness never go together.</p>

regularity of attendance?</p>

the toilet should be attended to. Frequent bathing and
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'propor attentions'">proper attentions</ins> to the hair, the teeth, the nails, are of
no slight importance. The clothing also should be
clean. Pupils who fail to observe these directions not

<p>Proper respect for the school will deter pupils from
throwing on school-grounds, or on the steps of buildings,
or on the floors of the corridors or of the school-room,
whatever is unsightly.</p>

<p>The same may be said with reference to chalk or pencil

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>In stormy weather pupils should not enter a school-building
without first cleaning the shoes or removing
rubbers. They should enter quietly and <em>never</em> be noisy
or boisterous inside of a school-room. Running or jumping,
or stepping on the seats or desks, is not allowable.</p>

<p>Pupils should take care of what they use but do not
own. Books or any materials furnished by the school
should be carefully and economically used. Moreover,
if pupils are well-bred their own books will be devoid of
finger-marks or cuts, or of marks and soil of any kind
except that which comes from constant use.</p>

<p>Questions. If pupils have the proper feeling for their
school, what care will they take of the grounds? Of the
buildings? Of the furniture?</p>

<p>How show good breeding in economy?</p>

<p>What rule holds good in returning borrowed articles?</p>

<p>How should school-books be used even by their
owners?</p>

<p>Show how all these things are indicative of good
breeding.</p>

<p>Show how they are one step towards good citizenship.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90 lsp">LESSON 6.</p>

<p><b>Purpose.</b>&mdash;To show how pupils should conduct themselves
towards their teachers.</p>

<p><b>Method.</b>&mdash;Item to be read with or without comment.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>The Lesson.</em></p>

<p>1. When pupils are placed under the charge of a teacher
it is supposed the teacher knows what is for their best
good; consequently a teacher’s directions should be respected
and obeyed. In matters pertaining to conduct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
pupils should yield their opinions to that of a wise and
faithful teacher, and should do it with quick and cheerful
obedience. Sulking, contradiction, or delay in obeying
are not only wrong, but inexcusably rude.</p>

<p>2. Oftentimes pupils seem to regard it as no impoliteness
to interrupt a teacher either by inattention, disorder,
or questions, when a lesson is in progress. There
are times when certain questions relative to lessons are
in order, but irrelevant questions, or unnecessary requests,
or hand-raising or shaking before a teacher has
finished speaking, are just as impolite in a school-room
as elsewhere. There are, of course, certain usages
peculiar to a school-room which would not be considered
in order elsewhere, because unnecessary; but, generally
speaking, good manners in a school-room and in a parlor
are the same.</p>

<p>3. Pupils should be kind and thoughtful in assisting
teachers whenever it is possible, by handing anything
needed, or by waiting upon them in any way. Boys,
especially, should be quick to offer help in erasing blackboards,
in lifting heavy articles, or in picking up anything
accidentally dropped. All pupils should help to
put things in their proper places and to keep the school-room
in order. This is kindness and politeness.</p>

<p>4. Boys should always take off their hats before entering
a school-room, and should not put them on at
dismissal, until they reach the outside door. If a teacher
should stand at that door, hats should not be put
on until the teacher is passed. When boys meet a
teacher in the street they should always raise their hats,
whether the teacher be a gentleman or a lady. Both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
school and out, when pupils speak <em>to</em> or <em>of</em> their teacher,
they should speak the real name, and not use the indefinite
title, “Teacher.”</p>

<p>8. When your hands are not occupied with books or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>

<p>23. Do not eat in school.</p>

<p class="fs90"><em>Note.</em>&mdash;When these “reminders” are given to young pupils

<span class="fs90"><em>PERSONAL HABITS.</em></span></h2>


<p><em>Note.</em>&mdash;These directions, although exceedingly important,
are not, in many cases, agreeable topics of conversation.
Therefore, in giving them, teachers must
use their good taste and discretion in deciding whether
to give arbitrarily or not. When they are given without
comment they should be impressed on the memory of
the child by calling for frequent repetitions of items,
and by patient and continued enforcement of directions,
whenever the occasion presents itself. The connection
between the direction and the spirit of kindness should
be traced whenever it is possible to do so. Lessons on
manners in school may be taken as a guide when it is
thought best to enlarge upon any item. Whether or
not a lesson be given to the younger children on the
importance of attending to personal habits may be left
to the discretion of a teacher.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90 lsp">LESSON 7.</p>

<p><b>Purpose.</b>&mdash;To show the necessity of attention to personal
habits.</p>

<p><b>Method.</b>&mdash;An item read with or without comment.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>The Lesson.</em></p>

<p>Although personal habits are not pleasant topics of
conversation, it seems necessary to give them some consideration.
Many young people indulge in certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
practices that are disagreeable and impolite, perhaps not
so much from lack of knowledge of what is proper as
from thoughtlessness and from not appreciating the importance
of giving these matters due attention. Young
people should realize that these matters, although seemingly
trifling, are sufficient to show whether they have
been accustomed to polite society or not. There is nothing
which tells more quickly. Minute attention to personal
habits gives one an air of refinement and attractiveness
which can be gained in no other way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Suggestions for Instruction Relating to Personal
Habits.</span></h3>

<p>1. Whatever has been said in reference to cleanliness
in school applies out of school as well. Cleanliness is a
pretty certain sign of good breeding. Every consideration
of health and good taste and refinement urges to
cleanliness. Never think to hide uncleanliness. If
your habits are not neat, it will be known.</p>

<p>2. Never neglect the details of the toilet. Such
toilet offices as cleaning the nails, the ears, the nose, are
proper only in the privacy of one’s apartment. The
nails should not be bitten. It destroys their beauty,
and is an impolite and unhealthy habit.</p>

<p>3. Many people have a habit of continually feeling of
the face or hair. This is not a mark of refinement of
manners, and should not be indulged in. “Fussing”
with anything, twirling things, drumming, should be
avoided. When the hands are not necessarily employed,
they should be kept quiet.</p>

<p>4. The feet should not be kept constantly and unnecessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in motion, nor should they be brought into
notice when possible to avoid it. Young ladies should
not sit with the feet extended and crossed. No one
should sit with the feet on the rounds of a chair. Tapping
on the floor with the foot is not in good form.</p>

<p>5. Spitting is a disgusting habit. Avoid it whenever
it is possible. Never give attention or refer to a sore on
the face or hands when others are present. Yawning
and stretching in company are considered rude. Hiccoughing
and sneezing should be avoided, if possible.</p>

<p>6. The mouth should be kept closed, unless there is
some good reason for opening it. One who has a habit
of keeping the mouth open continually is considered
weak mentally, if not physically.</p>

<p>7. Incessant smiling or laughing is silly and disagreeable.
Smiling or laughing is allowable when there is
something to laugh at. Giggling is unpardonable.
Hearty laughter is allowable in some places, but boisterous
laughter never. As a general thing the countenance
should be kept in repose. This implies neither a silly
nor a stern expression, but one indicative of kindness
and common sense.</p>

<p>8. A loud or otherwise disagreeable voice is not a
mark of the best manners. If such a voice is natural, it
may be trained and toned down as in singing. A person
of real refinement may have a peculiar voice, but
not a disagreeably loud one. Humming is disagreeable
and impolite.</p>

<p>9. Boys should not carry their hands in their pockets.
Boys should not whistle when it will disturb or annoy
any one.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs90 lsp">LESSON 8.</p>

<p><b>Purpose.</b>&mdash;To specify some particulars of street
manners.</p>

<p><b>Method.</b>&mdash;Item read with or without comment.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>The Lesson.</em></p>

<p>No polite person will indulge in loud or boisterous
conduct on the street. Loud talk or laughter is very
ill-mannered. Only a quiet demeanor is allowable, and
one who indulges in any other is guilty of rudeness.
A complaint often made against pupils is that they are
inclined to be rude and selfish in not giving those whom
they meet their due share of the walk in passing.
Oftentimes boys in their play are so heedless as to jostle
against those passing on the sidewalk. This is selfish
and rude. If it happens accidentally, suitable apologies
should be made.</p>

<p>Questions.&mdash;In what tone of voice should one speak
in the street? What does loud laughter in the street
indicate? What demeanor is allowable? What fault
is found with the manners of pupils on the street?
What are your own observations in the matter? What
are your criticisms?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Suggestions for Further Instruction.</span></h3>

<p>In going to a place of amusement or entertainment it
is not polite to performers or audience to arrive late.
Arrive in season, take your seat quietly, and remain
quiet and attentive throughout the whole entertainment.
If there is any delay before the entertainment begins,
the time should not be spent in loud laughing or talking.
Nothing should be done to attract attention. Eating
candy, nuts, or anything else at a place of entertainment
is not in good form.</p>

<p>Too much cannot be said against talking or whispering
or moving about when an entertainment is in progress.
It shows either a lack of knowledge as to what
is proper, or a disregard of propriety. It is also a rudeness
to the performers, and a great source of annoyance
to those who wish to listen. If the entertainment does
not prove interesting, it is still the part of a lady or
gentleman to remain through it all and to give respectful
attention. It is very impolite to leave the place before
the entertainment is concluded, in order to avoid
passing out with the crowd.</p>

<p>Loud and long continued applause is impolite. It is
proper to show pleasure if the entertainment pleases, but
it must be done without boisterousness.</p>

<p>Rapping on the floor with canes, stamping of feet,
whistling, etc., are insults, and if continued should
receive the attention of a policeman.</p>

<p>It is a sign of good breeding to be in church before
the service begins. If unavoidably late, enter very
quietly, between parts of the service. Never whisper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
or laugh in church. It is irreverent and ill-bred. Never
look around when people enter. Never be guilty of
rudeness or boisterousness in a church, whether on Sunday
or other days. Always show a proper respect for
the place.</p>

<p>In your own church be polite to strangers. If it seems
to be your place to do so, show them to a seat. Let no
peculiarity of dress or manner on the part of strangers
keep you from showing them any civility in church. In
attending a church not your own be respectful in your
conduct. Do not show curiosity nor ridicule observances
that may seem peculiar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Reminders.</span></h3>

<p class="fs90 pad2">In giving these to the pupils seek to arouse discussion.</p>

<p>1. When walking on the sidewalk, if you meet a person,
keep to the right of the walk.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“’Tis a rule of the land that when travelers meet</p>
<p class="verse">In high-way or by-way, in alley or street,</p>
<p class="verse">On foot or in wagon, by day or by night,</p>
<p class="verse">Each favor the other and turn to the right.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>2. It is polite to recognize friends and acquaintances on
the street. It is a custom of gentlemen to take off their
hats when friends are met. They should take off their
hats to gentlemen as well as to ladies. Both boys and
girls should show special respect to any old person they
may meet. The salutation should always be in a pleasant
and friendly tone of voice. The face should show respect
to acquaintances, and cordiality to friends. The name
should be added to the salutation, as “Good-morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Mr. A.” Never give the salutation as if it were a question.
Never greet any one by “Halloa.”</p>

<p>3. If a gentleman is walking or driving with a lady
acquaintance, he should take off his hat to any lady
whom she recognizes.</p>

<p>4. When a lady accidentally drops anything in the
street, any gentleman near, whether an acquaintance or
not, should pick it up and hand it to her. The lady should
not fail to acknowledge the courtesy. As the gentleman
passes on, he should touch his hat to the lady. This
civility of picking up things or assisting in any way
should be shown to elderly and infirm people by girls as
well as by boys.</p>

<p>5. It is impolite to turn and look at people after they
have passed. It is rude to stare at them if peculiar in
dress or manner. Special care should be taken not to
stare at the deformed or unfortunate. Put yourself in
their places and think how you would like to be treated.</p>

<p>6. It is considered impolite for people to gather in
groups or crowds on the sidewalk and to obstruct the way.
If two people meet who wish to converse with each other,
one should turn and walk in the direction in which the
other is going. It is not considered proper to stop for
conversation on the street.</p>

<p>7. It is not the custom of well-bred people to chew
gum, nor to eat fruit, nuts, or anything else, on the
street.</p>

<p>8. One of the rudest things a boy or girl can do is to
call out to a teacher or other person on the street. It is
only the most ill-bred who will do it. The law can
punish for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>9. If a stranger inquires the way, take great pains to
direct him, even if it requires some effort.</p>

<p>10. When in street cars or steam cars, if seats are lacking,
it is the rule that gentlemen give up their seats to
ladies. Ladies should not fail to thank gentlemen for
this kindness.</p>

<p>Whenever any attention is shown a lady, such as
opening or closing a window, taking bundles from the
racks, etc., the lady should politely acknowledge it, and
the gentleman should touch his hat as he turns away.</p>

<p>No one should occupy more room than is necessary, if
by so doing others are deprived of a seat.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs90 lsp">LESSON 9.</p>

<p><b>Purpose.</b>&mdash;To show the importance of good table
manners.</p>

<p><b>Method.</b>&mdash;An item read with or without comment or
questions asked.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>The Lesson.</em></p>

<p>Perhaps the question of <em>how</em> to eat is not of quite the
importance as <em>what</em> to eat, but in some particulars pertaining
to the laws of health the two are of equal rank.
<em>How</em> to eat is of much more importance than many
young people think, inasmuch as it is a certain test of
delicacy and refinement. If a person eats immoderately
fast, no one truly refined will set him down as a gentleman.
If one defies the regulations which society has
made relative to table manners, he is classed as decidedly
ill-bred or ignorant. It is well to study the etiquette of
the table, and to put in use those practices that have been
decided by the best society as being proper.</p>

<p>Questions.&mdash;Should the rules of society as to table
manners be disregarded? What does a lack of good
table manners indicate? Are table manners indicative
of character?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Subjects for Additional Lessons.</span></h3>

<p class="pfs100"><em>Deference to the Lady of the House at Table.</em></p>

<p><b>Suggestions.</b>&mdash;Do not be late at the home table. Never
be late when a guest. Do not take your seat at the
table until the lady of the house takes hers, nor rise
from the table until she gives the signal. If necessary
to leave the table before the meal is over, ask to be excused
of the one presiding.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><em>Polite Phraseology of the Table.</em></p>

<p><b>Suggestions.</b>&mdash;When it is desired that any article on
the table be passed, a servant should be asked, if there is
one near. If not, the request should be made of some
one at the table, as follows: “Please pass the bread,”
“I would thank you for the bread,” “Will you be kind
enough to pass the bread?” etc.</p>

<p>When offered anything at the table, the acceptance
should be accompanied by “Thank you.” If anything
is declined, it should be with “No, I thank you,” or
“Not any, I thank you.”</p>


<p class="pfs100"><em>Selfishness at Table.</em></p>

<p><b>Suggestions.</b>&mdash;To take the best when there is any
choice in the food is to show a very selfish disposition.
This does not apply when urged to do so, but to seem to
wish the best is inexcusable.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Reminders.</span></h3>

<p>1. Sit reasonably near the table, neither too near nor
too far away. Never place the elbows on the table.
Do not sit so far away as to be obliged to lean forward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Do not bend over the plate. Do not spread the elbows
when cutting meat, etc.</p>

<p>2. Young people should wait patiently and quietly
until the older ones at table have been served. While
waiting to be served, the knife or fork or napkin ring,
or any other table article, should be left untouched.
The hands should be quietly folded in the lap until one
is served. The napkin may be spread over the lap when
one first sits down at the table. Gentlemen do not now
tuck the napkin under the chin.</p>

<p>3. It is proper to begin eating as soon as served,
although there should be no indecorous haste. An exception
to this rule is that no one should begin to eat
the dessert until all are served.</p>

<p>4. Do not help yourself first to anything on the table.
Never put your own knife, fork, or spoon into the food
except as it has been served to you. It is rude to reach
across the table or to rise and reach in order to help
yourself. If servants are not near, ask politely of some
one at the table that the dish be passed.</p>

<p>5. Rapid eating is impolite and unhealthy. The
mouth should not be filled too full, and the food should
be thoroughly chewed. Do not chew the food so as to be
heard. Do not smack the lips in eating. Do not draw
in the breath when eating soup, drinking milk, tea, etc.
Be careful not to show the food in your mouth. Do not
attempt to eat the last drop of soup nor the last morsel
of food on the plate.</p>

<p>6. The knife is used in cutting up the food, but it
should not convey the food to the mouth. The fork
should be used for this purpose. There is a proper way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of holding knife and fork which can best be learned by
observing some one who does it properly. Soup should
be eaten from the side of the spoon.</p>

<p>7. When drinking tea or coffee, drink from the cup
and not from the saucer. When drinking from a goblet
or tumbler, be careful not to tip them too much. It is
not in good form to throw the head back and invert the
tumbler. It is not well to drink much water while
eating.</p>

<p>8. If necessary to eject anything from the mouth
while eating, use the fork in conveying it from the
mouth to the plate. Fruit stones may be removed with
the fingers and placed upon the plate.</p>

<p>9. When salt is taken from the salt-cellar, it should
be put on the plate and not on the table-cloth. Vegetables
should be eaten with a fork, if possible, rather
than with a spoon. When small dishes are used in
serving vegetables, fruit, etc., they should not be taken
in the hand, but left on the table.</p>

<p>10. It is a disputed question what to do with the
knife and fork when the plate is passed for a second
supply. It seems the better plan not to leave them on
the plate, as they are liable to fall off or to be in the
way, but to hold them in the right hand, or to place
them on the table in such a manner as not to soil the
cloth.</p>

<p>11. Do not use a tooth-pick in public. It is a common
practice, but not with the best-bred people. Never
indulge in the disgusting practice of removing bits of
food from the teeth with the tongue or fingers. The
teeth should receive attention in private.</p>

<span class="fs90"><em>MANNERS IN SOCIETY.</em></span></h2>


<h3><span class="fs90">SUGGESTIONS FOR LESSONS.</span></h3>

<p>1. When a request is to be made, no matter how
slight, it should be given in the form of a request and
not of a command. Such expressions as “Please” and
“Will you be so kind?” should be very frequently used.
When a request has been complied with, “Thank you”
should never be forgotten.</p>

<p>2. Gentlemen should not remain seated when there
are ladies or older people standing in the room. No
young people should remain seated when by so doing
they oblige older people to stand. Young people should
not occupy the easiest chairs nor the most comfortable
places in a room when older people are present.</p>

<p>3. Whispering in company is ill-mannered. Laughing
at something not understood by the whole company,
or at least by all who would notice the laughing, is
very impolite. Exchanging glances or meaning smiles
is rude. Boisterous laughter is always rude.</p>

<p>4. If asked to sing or play or to contribute in any
legitimate way to the entertainment of company, one
should, if possible, comply with the request without
waiting to be urged. When one is trying to entertain a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
company, the company should give respectful attention,
never annoying the performer by whispering or talking
or moving about. When games are proposed, unless
there is some reason for not doing so, every one who is
invited to join in them should do so with right good
will. Good manners are based on kindness, and a kind
heart will lead any one to contribute as much as possible
to the enjoyment of all.</p>

<p>5. One should give respectful and kindly attention to
another who is talking to him. No matter if the conversation
is not of great interest, it should be listened to
without interruption. This is especially true when
elderly people talk to those younger. When it is necessary
to discontinue the conversation, one should ask to
be excused. When two people begin to talk at the same
time, each should be ready with an “Excuse me,” or
“I beg pardon,” to yield the privilege of speaking first
to the other.</p>

<p>6. It is a mark of good manners to show courtesy to
servants or to any in humble stations in life. A polite
request is always better than a stern command. Whoever
shows disregard of the feelings of a servant or one
in humble station, gives unmistakable proof of ill-breeding.</p>

<p>7. It is courteous to commend what is commendable.
One should take pains to express commendation in words
to the one who deserves it. This is really no more than
common politeness. Many find it easy to speak words
of blame, but do not seem to think what gratification a
word of deserved praise affords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Reminders.</span></h3>

<p>1. When asked a question to be answered by Yes or No
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'it is considred'">it is considered</ins> more polite to say “Yes, Mrs. A.” than
“Yes, ma’am.” “Yes, sir” and “No, sir” are allowable,
but “Yes, Mr. A.” is better. When something is
said, and the one to whom it is said does not hear or
understand, the following questions are proper: “Sir?”
“I beg pardon,” “What did you say, Mrs. A.?”
When a person’s name is spoken before a question is
asked, the response should be “Sir?” or “Yes, Mrs.
A.?”</p>

<p>2. When entering a private house gentlemen should
remove their hats. Any one should remove rubbers.
Umbrella, hat, overcoat, or waterproof should be left in
the hall.</p>

<p>3. In entering a parlor, host and hostess should be
first sought out and spoken to. If the family only be
present, the one entering may properly shake hands with
all. This is partly a matter of choice, but if it is either
a formal or an informal call (not a business call) it is
highly proper. When the company is large, it is unnecessary.
The same direction applies in leaving.</p>

<p>4. When in company or when making a call, lounging
or rocking should not be indulged in. Sitting with the
chair tipped in any way, or with the feet on the rounds
of the chair, is not allowable. Ladies should not sit
with the feet or knees crossed. Gentlemen should not
sit with the feet elevated. The feet should remain on
the floor, and should be as inconspicuous as possible.
No one should sit with the feet far apart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Fumbling or fussing with the watch-chain or with
a ribbon or anything else should be avoided; also drumming
with the fingers or twirling things. When the
hands are not necessarily occupied they should be kept
quiet. The same may be said of the feet. Swinging
the feet or keeping them in motion or prominently in
sight is not proper. Constant and unnecessary motion
of hands or feet gives one an appearance of restlessness
which is not at all conducive to elegance of manner.
Repose of manner should be cultivated.</p>

<p>6. Avoid passing directly in front of people when
possible. It is better, however, to pass in front of
others with a “Pardon me,” or “Excuse me,” than to
crowd behind them. A gentleman should allow a lady
to pass through a door before him, holding it open for
her, if necessary. Gentlemen should go up-stairs before
a lady, and behind her in coming down.</p>

<p>7. It is rude to stare at people in company, especially
if they are peculiar in any way. Seem not to notice any
deformity or any peculiarity of dress or manner. Remember
the Golden Rule.</p>

<p>8. Demonstrations of affection are out of place in company
or anywhere else in public. Girls should not sit or
walk with their arms about each other, or clasp hands,
or lean against each other. A gushing manner is silly
and impolite.</p>

<p>9. Reading to one’s self in company is not excusable.
Reading aloud is still worse, unless by special request.</p>

<p>10. When strangers are to be presented to each other,
the directions are as follows: Gentlemen should be presented
to ladies (as, Miss B., allow me to present Mr. C.),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
young men to elderly men, young women to elderly
women. People who have been introduced should make
some conversation with each other, and not turn rudely
away without a word.</p>

<p>11. When people make calls they should inquire at the
door for those whom they wish to see. They should also
send in their <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'names if unkown'">names if unknown</ins> to the one who comes to
the door. When callers enter a room, persons in the
room not inquired for should soon leave. No member
of the family should enter the room when one is receiving
calls unless it is very necessary, and then an apology
should be offered.</p>

<span class="fs90"><em>MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.</em></span></h2>

<h3><span class="hidden">MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.</span></h3>

<p>1. Never enter a private room without rapping.
Never look over a person’s shoulder when he is reading
or writing. Never read what is designed for another
person only. Be courteous in thought as well as in act.</p>

<p>2. Take good care of borrowed articles, and return
them in reasonable time. Never lend borrowed articles.
It is proper for the one who borrows to return the article
in person or to send by a servant. To compel the owner
to send for his property is a gross violation of good
manners.</p>

<p>3. When necessary to make an inquiry of a stranger it
should be prefaced with “Excuse me,” “Pardon me,”
or “Will you kindly tell me?”</p>

<p>4. In extending invitations for visits or parties it is
proper to state the time definitely. Punctuality in keeping
all engagements is a mark of good breeding in society
as well as in business.</p>

<p>5. When gentlemen are walking with ladies it is a
proper courtesy to offer to relieve them of their parcels,
parasols, shawls, etc.</p>

<p>6. When gifts or favors have been received, prompt
acknowledgment should be made. The slightest favor
deserves acknowledgment.</p>

<p>A boy once found a nest of young sparrows, and put
them into his hat. He then set the hat on his head,
thinking no one would know what was under it. As he
walked through the streets, instead of lifting his hat to
bow to people, he held it fast upon his head. This
made everybody wonder. At last one man said, “Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
me see if his hat has grown to his head.” Away went
the sparrows, as he lifted the hat from the boy’s head.
Everybody laughed; and now if a boy does not lift his
hat when he meets any one, people say, “Perhaps he
has sparrows under his hat.”&mdash;<cite>Selected.</cite></p>


<p class="pfs120">3. <span class="smcap lsp">The Unhappy Boy.</span></p>

<p>Once there was a king who had a little boy whom he
loved. He gave him beautiful rooms to live in, and
pictures and toys and books. He gave him a pony to
ride, and a row-boat on a lake, and servants. But for
all this the young prince was not happy. He wore a
frown wherever he went, and was always wishing for
something he did not have. At length a magician came
to court. He said to the king, “I can make your son
happy.” So he took the boy into a private room and
wrote something on a piece of paper. Next he gave the
boy a candle and told him to light it and hold it under
the paper and see what he could read. The boy did as
he had been told, and white letters on the paper turned
into a beautiful blue. They formed these words:&mdash;<br />

<p class="pfs120">4. <span class="smcap lsp">Which was the Gentleman?</span></p>

<p>Master Frank Amory went to the picnic, and so did
Jimmy Bell. Frank’s father was a rich man. Jimmy’s
father was a day-laborer. Frank wore handsome new
clothes, and Jimmy’s knees and elbows were patched, his
hat was torn, and he had no shoes. There was only one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
barrel of ice-water, with one drinking-cup; and as it was
a hot day there was a crowd around the barrel most of
the time. A half dozen girls had just come to get a
drink when Frank at the head of a file of boys came
running up, and snatching the cup rudely began to
drink.</p>

<p>“Shame on you, Frank!” said one of the girls.
“Don’t you know you always ought to let girls drink
first?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as girls are any better than I am,”
said Frank, as he started off again.</p>

<p>Not long after, Jimmy and some other boys had come
to the barrel, when shy little Minnie Carey came up.
“Wait boys!” said Jimmy, dipping out a cup of water.
“Let Minnie drink first.” And he very politely handed
her the cup. Minnie drank, and thanked him as she
handed it back again.&mdash;<cite>Selected.</cite></p>

In trying to thank her, his hat fell off and rolled into

<p>A gentleman advertised for a boy, and nearly fifty
applicants presented themselves. Out of that number
he selected one and dismissed the rest. “I should like
to know,” said a friend, “on what ground you selected
that boy, who had not a single recommendation.”
“You are mistaken,” said the gentleman. “He has a
great many. He wiped his feet when he came in, and
closed the door after him, showing that he was careful.
He gave his seat instantly to that lame old man, showing
that he was thoughtful. He took off his cap when he
came in, and answered my questions promptly, showing
that he was gentlemanly. He picked up a book which
I had purposely placed on the floor, and replaced it on
the table; and he waited quietly for his turn instead of
pushing and crowding, showing he was orderly and
honorable. When I talked to him, I noticed that his
clothes were brushed, his hair in order. When he wrote
his name, I noticed that his finger-nails were clean.

<p class="pfs120">15. <span class="smcap lsp">Treatment of the Aged.</span></p>

<p>A play was to be performed at the principal theatre
of Athens, and the seats were soon taken. When the
theatre was full, an old man came in and looked around
for a seat. He saw a party of young Athenians beckoning
to him. In order to get to them he had to climb
over seats and push his way through the crowd, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
when at last he reached them, they sat down, and, instead
of giving him the seat he had expected, took up all
the room, leaving the old man standing. In this theatre
were some seats fitted up for strangers. These were
filled by young Spartans, who were much displeased at
the conduct of the Athenians, and beckoned to the old
man to come to them. When he was near them, they all
arose and received him with great respect. As the whole
assembly saw this they burst into a shout of applause.
The old man then said, “The Athenians <em>know</em> what is
right, but the Spartans practise it.”&mdash;<cite>Selected.</cite></p>


<p class="pfs120">16. <span class="smcap lsp">Civility to Strangers.</span></p>

<p>It was through his civility to two strangers that Mr.
Winans of Philadelphia is said to have obtained, some
years ago, his invitation to go to St. Petersburg and
manufacture locomotives for the Russian Czar. The
Russian agent had been shown with indifference through
the larger establishments of Philadelphia, but on their
coming to Mr. Winans, who owned a third or fourth rate
factory, he took so much pains to show all its parts and
workings, and was so patient in his explanations and
answers to their inquiries, that within a year he was surprised
when asked to transfer his works to Russia. He
went, and accumulated a large fortune.</p>


<p class="pfs120">17. <span class="smcap lsp">A Good Rule.</span></p>

<p>When you rise in the morning, form the resolution to
make the day a happy one to a fellow-creature. It is
easily done: a left-off garment to the man who needs it;
a kind word to the sorrowful; an encouraging word to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the striving; trifles, in themselves as light as air, will do
at least for the twenty-four hours. And if you are old,
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'rest assurred'">rest assured</ins> it will send you gently and happily down
the stream of time to eternity. By the most simple
arithmetical sum look at the result. If you send only
one person happily through the day, that is three hundred
and sixty-five in the course of a year. And suppose
you live forty years after you begin that course, you have
made fourteen thousand six hundred persons happy, at
all events, for a time.</p>


<p class="pfs120">18. <span class="smcap lsp">Character.</span></p>

<p>Nothing can compensate for the lack of manliness in
a man, and womanliness in a woman. The man may be
a capable business man, an eloquent speaker, and accomplished
scholar; but if he lacks manliness, he remains
only half a man. The woman may be intelligent, accomplished,
refined; but if she lacks womanliness, she
lacks everything. In some of the Old-World universities
there are courses in “Humanity.” It is a pity that the
teaching of humanity in the wider sense of that which
makes man man, and woman woman, does not occupy
a larger place in the catalogues of our schools and
colleges.&mdash;<cite>Dr. Trumbull.</cite></p>


<p class="pfs120">19. <span class="smcap lsp">Honor.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Smiles in one of his admirable books says that
Wellington was once offered half a million for a State
secret, not of any special value to the government, but
the keeping of which was a matter of honor. “It appears
you are capable of keeping a secret,” he said to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
official. “Certainly,” he replied. “And so am I,” said
the general, and bowed him out.</p>


<p class="pfs120">20. <span class="smcap lsp">Consideration for Others.</span></p>

<p>Sir Ralph Abercrombie, when mortally wounded, found
under his head the blanket of a private soldier, placed
there to ease his dying pains. “Whose blanket is this?”
“Duncan Roy’s.” “See that Duncan Roy gets his
blanket this very night,” said Sir Ralph, and died without

<p>Calvert says, “A gentleman may brush his own shoes
or clothes, or mend or make them, or roughen his hands
with the helve, or foul them with dye-work or iron-work;
but he must not foul his mouth with a lie.”</p>


<p class="pfs120">22. <span class="smcap lsp">Delicacy.</span></p>

<p>The gentleman never <em>sees</em> deformity. He will not talk
to a beggar of his rags, nor boast of his health before the
sick, nor speak of his wealth amongst the poor; he will
not seem to be fortunate amongst the hapless, nor make
any show of his virtues before the vicious.&mdash;<cite>T. T. Munger.</cite></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
